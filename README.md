# OpenVapour â€” FLOSS Torrent Manager
OpenVapour is a C# front-end for [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) focused on fast searches. As [FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html), the project is completely open source and uses no 3rd party libraries such as NUGET packages.

This tool is in early access! Please report bugs [here!](https://github.com/lily-software/OpenVapour/issues) Additionally, this is a 2 year old project of mine that I recently came back to and improved, there is definitely room for optimization and as such it may run poorly on low-end systems.

## Torrent Management
**OpenVapour is not a torrent client! An external torrent client capable of interpreting 'magnet' links is required!**
Personally, I highly encourage use of [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), as a reliable, open-source torrent client.
